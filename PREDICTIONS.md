## double (n)
I predict this function will return a number that is twice the value of the input.
If I use 2 as n, I expect the output to be 4.

## square()
I predict this function will return the value of the input multiplied by itself.
If I use 5 as n, I expect the output to be 25.

## isEven()
I predict that this function will return true if n is even (divisible by 2 with
no remainder) and false otherwise.

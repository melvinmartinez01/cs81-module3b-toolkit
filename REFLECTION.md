## Reflection

### Patterns or Surprises
1. The patterns I noticed were the use of the word function and the curly bracket placement. I was not much surprised since it completely
reminded me of how C programming works.

### Logic Challenges
2. A challenege that I faced was working with even and odd numbers. I had to go back to notes, reading, and my own research to figure out
both functions.

### Real-World Use
3. A toolkit like this could be useful for applications that could calculate, validate, and create a grading system that requires 
mathematical calculations.
